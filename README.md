# Croppy: Plant Pixels, Harvest Reality

## Overview

In a world where we all love to know where our food comes from, there's a surprising twist: while many of us are curious, only a few truly grasp the story behind their meals. We're all beginning to care more about eating healthily, selecting sustainable options, and understanding the process behind our plates. This gap between curiosity and knowledge is where we saw a giant playground waiting for exploration, and we decided to share it with everyone else. Welcome to **Croppy** - a journey to the heart of farming without getting your hands dirty.

## Features

**Croppy** isn't just any app; it's a real-life based game where we leverage real-time data to support user decision processes while using historical data to ensure an engaging gaming dynamic. Here are some features that make **Croppy** stand out:

- **Real-Time and Historical Data Utilization:** Make informed decisions in your virtual farm by leveraging data just like real farmers do.
- **Learn by Doing:** The concept of learning through action makes the educational experience fun and subtle.
- **Social Sharing and Competitions:** Share your achievements with friends, compete in the public leaderboard, and win rewards.
